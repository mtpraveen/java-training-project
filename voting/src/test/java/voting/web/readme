Before running selenium tests you should download Selenium Server:
http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/detail?name=selenium-server-standalone-2.0b3.jar&can=2&q= 

Server can be started by the command:
$ java -jar selenium-server.jar

At first, change userName, password and email constants in AdminTest, UserTest to values according to the existing admin and user account
After than you can run SeleniumAllTests.java
Try to run TearDown.java before test if you have some problems.
